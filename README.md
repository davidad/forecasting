FORECASTING (project currently dormant)
===

This represents a thoroughly incomplete project I worked on a bit towards the end of 2012 but that dropped off the bottom of my stack a while ago. I may rescue it at some point.

Some of my notes are reproduced below. "wbe.lua" is also a good place to look, though I only got about 25% done writing it.

thinking in terms of probabilistic inference...

what I want to do is establish a state space for humanity w.r.t WBE,
at any given point in time, the state may involve multiple technologies serving the same purpose but making different tradeoffs, like block-face EM vs. ATLUM. so what we're really making looks sort of like a class hierarchy...

the aim of this subproject would be to produce a program that can run Monte Carlo simulations to answer questions like "what's the posterior distribution of the date of the first successful human upload"

I also want to be able to produce useful milestones, which are defined as milestones such that:
a) we have a decent prediction of when they will happen
b) knowing that they did happen on schedule, or why they didn't, would improve certainties for the rest of the process
